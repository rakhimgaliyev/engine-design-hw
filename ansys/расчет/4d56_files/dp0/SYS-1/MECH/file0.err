 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       3.828   TIME= 01:20:58
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       4.953   TIME= 01:20:58
 Material number 11 (used by element 48544) should normally have at      
 least one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of      
 energy by material may not be available.                                

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       6.062   TIME= 01:20:58
 Overconstraint may occur for Lagrange multiplier or MPC based contact   
 algorithm.                                                              

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       6.062   TIME= 01:20:58
 Certain contact elements (for example 49303 & 48047) overlap with       
 other.                                                                  

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      11.016   TIME= 01:21:03
 Pivoting has been activated for the Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver .  
 The memory required may greatly exceed the predicted amount.  In that   
 event, use the DSPOPTION command to change the memory mode and/or       
 memory size used by the Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver.               

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      25.234   TIME= 01:21:18
 The rotational degree of freedom of pilot node 89810 is not well        
 constrained which can cause rigid body motion.
