 Material number 9 (used by element 53161) should normally have at least 
 one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of energy by  
 material may not be available.                                          

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      10.500   TIME= 01:17:37
 Pivoting has been activated for the Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver .  
 The memory required may greatly exceed the predicted amount.  In that   
 event, use the DSPOPTION command to change the memory mode and/or       
 memory size used by the Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver.

 The rotational degree of freedom of pilot node 102475 is not well       
 constrained which can cause rigid body motion.
